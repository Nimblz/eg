long ago, the eg gangs were divided and ceaselessly waged war apon one another.
But a great and terrible darkness descended apon the world of eg. Scoobis, a
cosmic horror from the deepest reaches of the great dark void, came to eg to devour
all. The strongest of the gangs, the yeehaws, united the many eg gangs and fought
to protect their world against the mighty scoobis, but they were not powerful enough.
It was not until the traffic cones found /the great weapon/ that they were able to
repel scoobises relentless attacks. It was not enough though, scoobis could never
be truely killed. In order to protect the universe from scoob's wrath, the leaders
of the gangs sealed scoobis away into the mountain, but at a cost. The leaders souls 
were trapped forever within the mountian, their strength keeping scoobis sealed away
for all of time.
