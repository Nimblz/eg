## intentions
      I want to make a chill game in the vein of blammo. I want a vast world where
   quirky custom characters can explore and interact. I want npc characters to talk
   to and complete objectives with. I want hidden items and power up abilities
   placed around the map. I want a currency system with coins spawned around the map
   that players can collect. Players may use coins to buy hats and other custom-
   ization items.

## target audience
 * People who want a world to explore and items to find, akin to the 2013 egg hunt.
 * Memers

## design goals
 * Use rodux and roact in a large(ish) project
 * Learn better organizational techinques
 * loose coupling between dependencies
 * avoid mutual dependencies, it's a code smell :(
